# calculator
Calculator built as part of the Odin Project

Bugs to fix:
    FIXED: Do not allow decimal if decimal present
    FIXED: Handle repeating decimal e.g 11/3
    FIXED: Handle non-numbers (#/0)
    FIXED: Prevent additional digits being added after enter is pressed.
    FIXED: Handle when enter pressed before input
    *When enter pressed afer an operation, repeat last operation
        e.g. if 3 + 6 enter (9) then enter pressed display 15.
